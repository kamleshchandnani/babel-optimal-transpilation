// We support resolving modules according to `NODE_PATH`.
// This lets you use absolute paths in imports inside large monorepos:
// https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/253.

// It works similar to `NODE_PATH` in Node itself:
// https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders

// We will export `nodePaths` as an array of absolute paths.
// It will then be used by Webpack configs.
// Jest doesnâ€™t need this because it already handles `NODE_PATH` out of the box.

// Note that unlike in Node, only *relative* paths from `NODE_PATH` are honored.
// Otherwise, we risk importing Node.js core modules into an app instead of Webpack shims.
